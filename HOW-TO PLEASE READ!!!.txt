# NicehashMiner gaco-mod
First we need to set up EWBF
1. Go to devices and algorithms settings
2. Disable all algo's and leave EWBF enabled only
3. Click on EWBF and change on right side and set Benchmark speed to some value (100 for ex)
4. Save and start nicehash miner, wait a while until its minning speed is stabilized, write down hashrate
5. Go back to EWBF algorithm settings and put that hashrate int

SIA:
Do the same as above for SIA but wen putting in the hashrate add '000000' to scale for MH/s

Dual Mining:
Start with DaggerPascal
1. Do the same as for EWBF but
2. When miner is running and miner window is active you can use '+' and '-' on your keyboard
3. to find the right balance of ETH/Second algo in terms of profit once you get that write it down
4. Go back to DaggerPascal settings and in 'Extra Launch parameters' add '-dcri 100' where 100 is the value you found yourself by experimenting 
6. Do the same for DaggerLbry Sia and Decred

Now you can start benchmarking
Open benchmark make sure you choose precise benchmark
Check all algos except EWBF and SIA as this you benchmarked manually
Hit start and wait, once it is done YOU're ready to start mining and make profits :)

REMEMBER to find out dcri setting first before doing benchmark to make sure automatic switching will work as desired

Don't hesitate to contribute i aim to keep this updated at least until original nicehashminer will start accepting patches more quickly
THANKS AND HAVE FUN
